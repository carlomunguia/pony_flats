# Pony Flats: a Pony production

*This is a `learning repo for the Pony programming language`. It will cover `all basic syntax, features, as well as stabs at projects` that `may off shoot into official repos of their own`.  None the less, I find enough interest in this newish language to `dedicate time to learning & digesting it`.  Any helpful hints from `Pony developers are welcome! :D`*
